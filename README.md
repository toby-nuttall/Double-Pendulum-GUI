# Double-Pendulum-GUI
I made a double pendulum GUI with python, with interactive initial conditions sliders
just run the python file, required packages (PyQt5, numpy, matplotlib, collections)
there are some bugs, for instance if you start and stop the animation too quickly the animation continues running in the background and gets laggy or crashes, if this just happens just close and rerun the programme, not honestly sure how to fix this as I'm not sure it's possible to stop/delete funcanimations from the GUI as it runs.
