# Double-Pendulum-GUI
I made a double pendulum GUI with python, with interactive initial conditions sliders <br>
just run the python file, required packages (PyQt5, numpy, matplotlib, collections)<br>
there are some bugs, for instance if you start and stop the animation too quickly the animation continues running in the background and gets laggy or crashes, if this <br> happens just close and rerun the programme, not honestly sure how to fix this as I'm not sure it's possible to stop/delete funcanimations from the GUI as it runs.
